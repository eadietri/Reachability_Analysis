# Reachability Analysis

A Python project implementing data-driven reachability analysis methods.

Reachability analysis is an important method in providing safety guarantees for systems with unknown or uncertain dynamics.

## Overview

This project contains implementations for different approaches to reachability, including *probabilistic guarantees* and *scenario-based methods*.
